# Laravel Project Setup

## Introduction

Welcome to your new Laravel project! This guide will walk you through setting up and configuring your Laravel application. By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional Laravel environment ready for development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **PHP** (version 7.3 or higher)
- **Composer**
- **Node.js** and **NPM**
- **MySQL** or your preferred database
- **Git**

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use Composer to install PHP dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```

Install NPM dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and update the configuration:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and update the following variables with your database and application details:

```env
APP_NAME=Laravel
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=base64:generated-app-key
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

### 4. Generate Application Key

Generate the application key:

```sh
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Migrate and Seed the Database

Run the migrations to create the database tables:

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

(Optional) Seed the database with sample data:

```sh
php artisan db:seed
```

### 6. Compile Assets

Compile the assets using Laravel Mix:

```sh
npm run dev
```

For production:

```sh
npm run prod
```

### 7. Serve the Application

Start the local development server:

```sh
php artisan serve
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
php artisan test
```

## Useful Commands

- **Clear Cache:**

  ```sh
  php artisan cache:clear
  php artisan config:clear
  php artisan route:clear
  php artisan view:clear
  ```
